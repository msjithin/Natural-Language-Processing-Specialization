# Natural Language Processing Specialization
Natural Language Processing Specialization DeepLearning.AI

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to interpret and manipulate human language. 

This technology is one of the most broadly applied areas of machine learning and is critical in effectively analyzing massive quantities of unstructured, text-heavy data. As AI continues to expand, so will the demand for professionals skilled at building models that analyze speech and language, uncover contextual patterns, and produce insights from text and audio.

This repo consists of the study materials and notebooks used during this specialization. This Specialization will equip you with machine learning basics and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques needed to build cutting-edge NLP systems:

Courses:
1. Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces.  
Use logistic regression, na√Øve Bayes, and word vectors to implement sentiment analysis, complete analogies, translate words, and use locality-sensitive hashing to approximate nearest neighbors.

2. Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models.  
Use dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and word embeddings to autocorrect misspelled words, autocomplete partial sentences, and identify part-of-speech tags for words.

3. Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models.  
Use dense and recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, GRUs, and Siamese networks in TensorFlow to perform advanced sentiment analysis, text generation, named entity recognition, and to identify duplicate questions. 

4. Natural Language Processing with Attention Models.  
Use encoder-decoder, causal, and self-attention to perform advanced machine translation of complete sentences, text summarization, and question-answering. Learn models like T5, BERT, and more with Hugging Face Transformers!
